# Terraform-AWS-Project 
 
# ðŸš€ AWS VPC Infra with Public & Private Load Balancers via Terraform

This project builds a **secure and scalable VPC infrastructure on AWS** using **Terraform**, complete with public/private subnets, EC2 proxy & backend instances, and load balancers. It provisions the entire setup across two AZs and uses **remote state storage in S3**, dynamic AMI fetching, and provisioning via `remote-exec`.
